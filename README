# intro

vacsrv is a vac file system.  it is different from vacfs in the
following ways:
- serves the contents of a single vac score (never multiple)
- handles multiple 9p2000 messages at a time
- keeps a cache of venti blocks

generally, it is meant to be faster than vacfs, usable as a root
file system.


# install

make sure $ROOT is set.  now "mk install" to compile and install the
files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- handle 9p2000 messages concurrently, and venti messages too
- implement block cache
- think about implementing a cache for other data structures, e.g. name lookups in dirs, for walks
- implement binary search when walking a name in a dir (metablock/metaentry)
- think about adding a mode where vacsrv prefetches an entire hashtree (to get it into a venti's cache)
